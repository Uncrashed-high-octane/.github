## What is Uncrashed?

**Uncrashed** is an adrenaline-fuelled racing game where every race turns into a scenario: crashes, repairs, rescue missions and survival in the chaos.  
Players don’t just aim for first place — they must navigate a world of realistic vehicle destruction, team up for emergency missions, rebuild and tune cars mid-race, and face dynamic multiplayer challenges.

## Development Story

The team behind Uncrashed spent over 3 years researching real crash physics, consulting stunt drivers and vehicle repair specialists. Early prototypes featured simple crashes; the final version combines open-world environments, cooperative rescue modes, VR compatibility and community-driven mod support.  
Their goal: transform racing into a full-scale cinematic action-experience where every impact matters.
